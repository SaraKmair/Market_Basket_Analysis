## Market basket analysis <br />
is a technique used by retailers to find patterns in customer behaviour based on their history of transactions. <br />
If a customer purchased item A what is the probability that the customer is buying item B along with it?
With Market Basket Analysis (MBA) we will discover what items are more or less likely to be bought together, and based on this analysis of the customers transaction history we can help tailor the following to be as effective as possible: <br />
* How to decide on what items should be organized on the shelves, paired together on sale, and/or reward more points <br />
* What customers shall we target with what ads <br />
* How can we increase the sales for a specific item <br />

The data set I am using for this analysis contains information about customers buying different grocery items at a mall <br />
